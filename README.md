# Grade School

If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster
for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort
  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted
  alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Let me think. We have
  Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1,
  Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2
  and Jim in grade 5.
  So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"

Note that all our students only have one name  (It's a small town, what
do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the
roster.
In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your
implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.
